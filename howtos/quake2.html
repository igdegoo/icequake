<h3>Quake II Guide</h3>

<p>If you do not have a copy, you can get it used from eBay or goodwills or you can download a pre-configured copy with the CD soundtrack from <a href="http://conglomo.pw/files/yoshi295295/network/quake/quake2/Quake%202.7z">here.</a> The copy provided by me uses Yamagi Quake 2, which is my recommended source port.</p>
<p>What if you prefer to install the game yourself?</p>
<p>If you have a physical Quake 2 CD or a ISO you want to install from, you will need a source port to play, since when you try to install the game on Windows XP and later, you will get a error.</p>
<p>There is a variety of source ports, but for this guide, we will focus on Yamagi Quake 2. Download it from <a href="https://deponie.yamagi.org/quake2/idstuff/q2-3.20-x86-full-ctf.exe">here.</a> Then put the file in a empty folder and run it. The file is a self-extracting archive. Extract the files to the folder, then delete the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.20_Changes.txt</li>
<li>quake2.exe</li>
<li>ref_gl.dll</li>
<li>ref_soft.dll</li>
<li>baseq2/gamex86.dll</li>
<li>ctf/ctf2.ico</li>
<li>ctf/gamex86.dll</li>
<li>ctf/readme.txt</li>
<li>ctf/server.cfg</li>
<li>xatrix/gamex86.dll</li>
<li>rogue/gamex86.dll</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have deleted the files, copy pak0.pak and the video folder from your CD/ISO to the baseq2 folder of the patch.</p>
<p>If you have mission packs, copy the pak0.pak and the video folder of each one into their respective folder:</p>
<p>The Reckoning: xatrix</p>
<p>Ground Zero: rogue</p>
<p>If you want to have the CD soundtrack for the basegame you have 2 options.</p>
<p>1. Download it from <a href="http://conglomo.pw/files/yoshi295295/network/quake/quake2/music.7z.">here.</a> This is a good option if you don't want to rip the songs yourself or you have the game in ISO form.</p>
<p>2. Rip the soundtrack from your CD using CDex. Be sure to set the ripped song filetype as OGG Vorbis. You can't rip track 1, since the track is used for data. After the songs are ripped, name the songs 02.ogg for track 02, 03.ogg for track 03 and so on until you reach track 11. Then put the songs into the music folder inside the baseq2 folder.</p>
<p>If you want to rip the songs from the mission pack CDs, you can do option 2 but instead of putting the songs inside the baseq2/music folder you put them inside the music folder of the respective folder for the mission packs.</p>
<p>The Reckoning: xatrix/music</p>
<p>Ground Zero: rogue/music</p>
<p>Once you are done with all that, go to <a href="https://www.yamagi.org/quake2">https://www.yamagi.org/quake2</a> and scroll down to the Downloads section.</p>
<p>Then click on the Precompiled Windows binaries link.</p>
<p>Extract the zip file you have just downloaded and move all of the files inside the patch. Start yquake2.exe and you should be playing Quake 2.</p>
